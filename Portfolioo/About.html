    <center><p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">Since you're busy I have short and long versions of my bio:</p></center>
    <br>
    <h2 class="Proj1Content">Short Version</h2> 
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">I'm currently working on developing further as a UX Designer specifically in my newfound interest in the XR field but overall, I hope to always be a constant learner and grow as a human that may one day impact someone else.</p>

    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2 class="Proj1Content">Long Version</h2> 
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">Although currently based in NYC, I originally lived in Banha, Egypt for quite a bit. Both those cities served as the foundation of who I<span>&#8217;</span>d eventually become. Seeing the difference between both cities made me realize how lucky I was to have moved to a place that flourishes with tech and opportunities. However, that same feeling made me want to change that and become something that my parents don<span>&#8217;</span>t quite understand yet. In my case, I<span>&#8217;</span>ll not only be the first designer in my family, but the first person to ever choose and pursue a career in tech. It<span>&#8217;</span>s scary because I basically have no guidance and have to make <span>&#8220;</span>adult<span>&#8221;</span> decisions on my own but it<span>&#8217;</span>s still exciting and serves as my passion.</p>

    <br><br>

    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">I work with a variety of digital mediums including Extended Reality (XR), programming, audio and user experience design. Technology, as broad as the term is, is used to prompt different emotion whether it's bad or good. For the tech to prompt the expected emotion it needs to be usable and efficient otherwise there would be no value to anyone. I plan on being the person that clears the blurred line between the user and the product, however, it<span>&#8217;</span>s hard to design incredible experiences without knowledge in different other sectors including business, psychology, and software development. And for that reason, I chose to pursue a Bachelor of Science in the Integrated Digital Media (IDM) Program at New York University (NYU) with minors in management and psychology. Both my minors helped me expand my horizon by meeting different people in other majors and think differently. IDM spans game design, web design and development, mobile app development, digital graphics, augmented and virtual reality, and UX Design. My major serves as a swiss blade that enables me to be a well versed designer.</p>
