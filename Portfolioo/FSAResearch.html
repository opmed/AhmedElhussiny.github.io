    <center><h2>Intro</h2></center>
    <br><br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">Federal Student Aid (FSA), an office of the U.S. Department of Education, is the largest provider of student financial aid in the United States. Federal Student Aid provides student financial assistance in the form of grants, loans, and work-study funds. Federal Student Aid is also responsible for the development, distribution, and processing of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the fundamental qualifying form used for all federal student aid distribution programs, as well as for many state, regional, and private student aid programs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">I'm currently working on the the Next Gen initiative which is a new regime that simplifies FSA and takes big steps toward improving the way students, parents, and borrowers interact with and access the benefits of the programs administered by Federal Student Aid.</p>
    <br>

    <center><h2>Problem</h2></center>
    <br><br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> The Federal Student Aid office needed a redesign of their website and therefore needed some UX Researchers to help find specific issues that needed to be fixed. The main problems with the old site was that:<p>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">1) The system is complex and expensive.</p>
   <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">2) Not user friendly and info overload.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">3) If a borrower defaults, their account goes through multiple handoffs, pinging from a servicer to a default management company to at least one private collection agency (PCA).</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">4) FSA lacks access to servicers<span>&apos;</span> and PCAs<span>&apos;</span> back-end information systems, which are owned and maintained by the companies. If FSA requires information, it must put together a detailed request and, in some cases, pay for the extra work the contractor must perform.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">5) Borrowers interact with their loan servicer to manage their accounts. Considering that borrowers normally have more than one loan servicer, each servicer maintains its own website, proprietary back-end software, customer service training programs, protocol for counseling borrowers, analytics, and outreach strategies. Managing different loan servicers can be difficult but in addition, when borrowers switch servicers, their account and all of the information attached to it must be correctly transmitted and set up in the new servicer<span>&apos;</span>s system which is a process that requires significant manual processing. The borrower also needs to learn to navigate the new system and set up a new login and payment account.</p> 
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">The redesigned site fixed some of the issues mentioned but we're still in the process of conducting more research for the reedesign to be complete. The work included here is what we've done so far and will surly be adding more updates as we work on it.</p>
    <br>

    <center><h2>Goals</h2></center>
    <br><br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">1) Launch a single website where all 35 million Direct Loan borrowers will manage their accounts, make payments, and apply for repayment programs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">2) Under a single portal, FSA will be able to more easily boot poor-performing contractors from the system with minimal disruption to the borrower, as the account will only need to be assigned to a new entity rather than completely transferred.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">3) Borrowers who default on their debts will not be siphoned off into a different system; they will still be able to manage their account and speak with a customer service representative through the same system where they managed their loans while in repayment.</p>
    <br><br>

    <center><h2>User Segmentation</h2></center>
    <br><br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> The team relied on the other inten and I to recruit users to be interviewd. Each of us interviewed 3 users (6 total); one highschool senior, two college freshmen, one college junior, and two graduates. We were aiming for a broad set of users since the website is used by highschoolers, college students, and adults/parents. We also abstained from interviewing students in design and research based degrees to avoid any biases.</p>
    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Methods & Approach</h2></center>
    <br>
    <h3 class="Proj1Content" style="font-size: 30px;">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> I created a heurisitc evaluation in order to quickly eye usability probelems before conducting any interviews or usability testing. There was 4 main issues I noticed that invovlved repetitivness, design issues, & content placement.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="Proj1Content" style="font-size: 30px;">Discussion Guide</h3>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> We created a discussion guide in google docs with the goal of confirming certian usability issues. 
    Since the discussion guide results was not diagnostic in providing specific details about the problematic areas, we needed to identify the key issues from the user perspective in a comprehensive way to help the product team achieve their business goals.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="Proj1Content" style="font-size: 30px;">Usability Testing</h3>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> Our supervisor sent over a prototype of what the redesign lookeed like in order conduct some usabiltiy testing on it. Although there were some issues that the users noticed in the prototype, they mentioned that it was a great upgrade from the old site.</p>
    <br>

    <center><h2>Outcomes & Impacts</h2></center>
    <h3 class="Proj1Content" style="font-size: 30px;">Impacts</h3>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;">This project was a huge success in advocating for UX research across the office in several ways:</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> 1) Identified user pain points & needs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> 2) The new site was launched around december 20th.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> 3) The research done helped clarify and unblur some of the issues that were present. Although there's more work to be done and the site isn't completely done, we still consider every step and progress a success.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 class="Proj1Content" style="font-size: 30px;">Outcome</h3>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> Below I have a comparison between the old site hompage (on the right) and the new launched site (on the left). A few things to notice:</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> 1) The most requested information is listed on the main page in the redesign while in the old site they were buried under all the tabs and navigation which required the user to exert effort and search for them.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> 2) Although it can't be seen in the images below, in the old site you would scroll for a little bit to reach the end of the page. It caused information overload and was overwhelming to many of the users we interviewed. The redesign included way less information on the homepage to decrease the information overload and make it easier for the users to find what they want quicker.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> 3) The redesign has a direct call to action in the middle of the page encouraging users to login and if they don't have an account they could create one. It wasn't visible in the old site since many things were emphsized and screamed for more attention as well the login button was small and wasn't in an ideal place.</p>
    <br>

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Reflections</h2></center>
    <br>
    <h3 class="Proj1Content" style="font-size: 30px;">Why the methods used?</h3>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> The heuristic evaluation was meant to give us a refresher of the site<span>&#8217;</span>s navigation while still eyeing noticable issues. The discussion guide helped us evaluate and confirm many of the uabulity issues that were present in the site. Usability testing is norm for checking if the prototype if what the user actually wants. We avoided surveying since we didn't think it was ideal for the tasks given to us but we might still use it in the future if needed.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="Proj1Content" style="font-size: 30px;">What would we have done differently?</h3>
    <p class="Proj1Content" style="color: #a9a9a9;"> I wish we interviewed more users but by the time we were ready to start interviewing it was around finals season so most students declined the offer. If we had started the inteviewing process earlier we would've been able to get more interviees thus gaining more feedback on the site.</p>
